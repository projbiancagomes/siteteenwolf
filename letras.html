         <h1>Who Are You, Really?</h1>
        <p>So you're feeling tied up to a sense of control</p>  
        <p>And make decisions that you think are your own</p>
        <p>You are a stranger here, why have you come?</p>
        <p>Why have you come, lift me higher, let me look at the sun</p>
        <p>Look at the sun and once I hear them clearly, say</p>

        <p>Who, who are you really?</p>
        <p>And where are you going?</p>
        <p>I've got nothing left to prove</p>
        <p>'Cause I've got nothing left to lose</p>

        <p>See how they run, lift me higher, let me look at the sun</p>
        <p>Look at the sun and once I hear them clearly, say</p>
            
        <p>Who, who are you really?</p>
        <p>And where are you going?</p>
        <p>I've got nothing left to prove</p>
        <p>'Cause I've got nothing left to lose</p>
        <p>See me bare my teeth for you</p>
        <p>See me bare my teeth</p>
